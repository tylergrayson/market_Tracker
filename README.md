# market_tracker

This application was built using the Java Spring Boot framework to consume data from a REST API and render it in a useable format. 
The data is saved in a remote MySQL database hosted on AWS.


The user of this application can request a quote with up-to-date financial market information about a company or ETF using the appropriate ticker symbol.
Once entered, the quote is displayed to the user and can be saved to the database. 
The user can then view a snapshot of the database with all stored quotes on a separate page.
